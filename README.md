## Detailed Description

The robot and the cube on the conveyor belt start at known coordinates. The goal is for the robot to move to the conveyor belt and adjust its joint angles to bring the end effector to the cube's position and grasp it. Subsequently, the robot moves to an appropriate position near the cart and, with precise arm movements, places the cube at the target coordinates.
